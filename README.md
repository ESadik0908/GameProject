# GunBoots Game Project

This project was part of my 3rd-year university module, Introduction to Video Games Programming.

The Game is a platform arena game with multiple enemy types, the goal is to survive as long as possible. As the objective of this project was mostly to demonstrate technical skill there is not much polish on the graphics and no sounds.

Objective:
Survive as long as possible. At the start of the game and then every 5 waves you choose one of three upgrades attached to a random weapon and then try and defeat as many enemies as you can.

The second branch of this repo is work done after the submission of this project as the save system uses the player prefs which means profile data is saved to the registry. Ideally, I'd like to change this so that player data is instead saved to a file.
